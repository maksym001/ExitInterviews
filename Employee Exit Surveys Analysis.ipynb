    "People who leave do not necessarily represent marginal views but those who have other options.  This might mean that many others who stay could be dissatisfied and therefore disengaged.  The letter affects organisational performance quite badly.  Disengagement sets the culture of stagnation whereby large emloyee percentage is focused on doing minimal work to get a paycheck.  "
